These debates have emerged as a response to failures of the welfare state on the one hand, and the threat to employment posed by increasing automation on the other. While issues surrounding introduction and maintenance of the UBI have been explored at some length in sociological and political science literature, economics as a discipline has been slow to enter this discussion. This paper applies a new institutional economic framework to explore the effects of UBI on the economy as well as broader social effects. It shows that while the costs of implementation and the threat of work disincentives are greater than has previously been indicated, the benefits of introducing a UBI far outweigh the drawbacks, particularly when an ongoing decrease in manual and middle class jobs due to automation is assumed. Implications for welfare and social policy are explored.\"\n\nWe need to decide if it is relevant. How useful is this for your assignment?\n\nA. Very\nB. Partly\nC. Not at all.",

With small but increasing use of AIs in service industries, there is a growing literature on the impact of robots and AI on everyday social interactions in a number of contexts; however, the effects of robots and AIs in educational contexts remain relatively unexplored. This study used ethnographic means to explore the impact of English language teacher robots in 3 primary school settings in Korea. It combined ethnographic non-participant observation with interviews to look at how language teaching could be technologically supported, drawing on the workplace studies of Heath and Luff (2000) to look at how the use of technologically-mediated language instruction offered a new range of affordances and constraints to both students and teachers. Implications for language pedagogy and curriculum development are explored.\"\n\nDo you think the information will be appropriately explored in this article, and not be too general or too specific to use in our assessment question?\n\nA.

Retrieved from http://theconversation.com/robot-revolution-rise-of-the-intelligent-automated-workforce-58252)\n\nStudent's paraphrase:\n\nThe growing use of AI in society does not preclude job growth. There are those that argue that, instead, the use of AI will lead to new forms of employment. For example, because machine learning systems have already become far too complicated for ordinary people to understand or fix, there will be new jobs that will emerge which will require people who can act as mediators between AI systems and humans (Bollegala, 2016).\n\nHas the student plagiarized the original?\n\nA.

I am writing to inform you that I will unfortunately be late to tomorrow's tutorial. I am a member of the Cronulla Sharks under-21s third grade side, and we are currently 2nd on the league table. However, we have an important game on Saturday with the no. 1 team, and because of this we will have a late training session the night before. The training session will run late, and I have never been good at waking up early, so I will need to sleep in. As a result I will be late to the tutorial.

As the building is still under construction, the problem is the worst at peak hour when the workers use the lifts to bring their tools and materials up to the top floors, however he still gets a lot of complaints at other times. The building manager decides to hire a work crew to come in and try and speed up the elevators, but unfortunately they tell him it isn't possible.\nThe construction won't be finished for another few months, so he needs to figure out how to get the elevators to work faster. It is starting to stress him out and the residents are getting more annoyed.\nOn the day that the construction crew bring in the mirrors for the apartments on level 11, he notices that he receives no complaints. The complaints start up again the next day, but oddly when the mirrors are delivered for level 12 there are no complaints either.\nThe manager suddenly realizes how he can reduce the number of complaints and installs mirrors next to the elevators on each floor. He also installs mirrors in each of the elevators and now only receives only one complaint a month.\"\nAdapted from Fogler \u0026 LeBlanc, 2011\nWhat was the real problem?\nRefer to lesson 3.1a and 3.1b.\nCheck one option.\n(a). The residents were bored waiting for the elevators.\n(b). The residents were annoyed at not having mirrors in their apartments.\n(c). The elevators were slow.\n(d).

This partial leg bone has been sharpened into a bone point. There is clear evidence of sharp stone tools being used to refine the bone, which were also found at the site. The fossil has no carnivore tooth marks on it and was found in a shelter on a steep escarpment unsuitable for climbing by this kind of marsupial herbivore.

Any right that owners may claim to property is superseded by the rights of homeless people to shelter, as the right to shelter is an inalienable human right. This right to shelter applies in almost all cases of unoccupied properties, but of course would not apply if the property was only unoccupied in the short term.\n(Adapted from Vasudevan, A.

Note that this particular reflection had a word limit of 200-550 words, and students were instructed to reflect on the idea of being a critically reflective teacher.\nStephen Brookfield (1995), in his analysis of why critical reflection is important to teaching, suggests that \"an uncritical stance towards our practice sets us up for a lifetime of frustration\" (para. 2). He suggests this is because teachers can have a different view of their classrooms to what is actually going on: they are unaware. This contradiction fascinates me. While on my prac placements, I was particularly conscious of this - lessons that I thought to be fantastic or boring, when looked at through a critical eye, turned out to be the opposite, or at least more in the middle. It was frustrating, to say the least. What we had learnt in our education theory courses didn't quite match up to real-life experience. Having my supervisor give me notes at the end really helped me in evaluating my teaching and planning the next lesson. This, coupled with my own observations of my students allowed me to more closely align what Brookfield would call the \"meaning and significance\" (para 2) I intended for the lesson to what the students took from it. While being observed sometimes felt a bit \"big brother\" and sometimes just embarrassing, I have no doubt that it made me a better teacher. These kinds of 'learning processes' throughout a teaching career are important because they force us to revaluate our practice; to, in effect, become aware.\nBrookfield, S. (1995). Becoming a critically reflective teacher.

Note that this particular reflection had a word limit of 200-550 words, and students were instructed to reflect on the idea of being a critically reflective teacher.\nStephen Brookfield (1995), in his analysis of why critical reflection is important to teaching, suggests that \"an uncritical stance towards our practice sets us up for a lifetime of frustration\" (para 2). He suggests this is because teachers can have a different view of their classrooms to what is actually going on: they are unaware. This contradiction fascinates me. While on my prac placements, I was particularly conscious of this - lessons that I thought to be fantastic or boring, when looked at through a critical eye, turned out to be the opposite, or at least more in the middle. It was frustrating, to say the least. What we had learnt in our education theory courses didn't quite match up to real-life experience. Having my supervisor give me notes at the end really helped me in evaluating my teaching and planning the next lesson. This, coupled with my own observations of my students allowed me to more closely align what Brookfield would call the \"meaning and significance\" (para 2) I intended for the lesson to what the students took from it. While being observed sometimes felt a bit \"big brother\" and sometimes just embarrassing, I have no doubt that it made me a better teacher. These kinds of 'learning processes' throughout a teaching career are important because they force us to revaluate our practice; to, in effect, become aware.\nBrookfield, S. (1995).

As part of one of his courses, Jon needs to collect data on the eating habits of first year university students. To do this, he has asked Mike and nine of his other friends to keep a record of what they eat, and when, for a week.\nMike agrees to help, and keeps a fairly accurate record of what he has eaten. When the week is up Jon asks Mike to email him his data. However, when Mike is typing up his eating habits for the week, he realises that he hasn't eaten any vegetables at all. Not wanting to seem unhealthy, especially because he doesn't want Jon to judge him, he pretends that he made a pumpkin soup and adds that to his list. He also adds a couple of salads to some of his main meals and deletes one of the chocolate bars. Satisfied, he emails the list to Jon.\"\n\nWhat is the problem in this scenario?\n\nA. Mike is a Philosophy student and therefore Jon shouldn't have asked him.\nB. Mike is falsifying data and this will twist the results of Jon's research.\nC. Jon should have asked strangers, not his friends, to collect the data for his assignment\nD. Jon didn't go through ethics approval before collecting his data.",

Your tutor has given you a hypothetical scenario involving a security threat. There are four people in your group - Steve, Gwen, Myriam and Ajay. You each have to play a role as the head of a government department. You must work together to coordinate your departments after the security incident. Myriam, who is playing Minister for Immigration, is the first to speak, saying, 'We'll call the army to secure the airports.'\"\n\nMyriam's assertion here is probably not the best thing to say to coordinate this group activity, and she should instead use a proposal. What would be a good example of a proposal she could use?\n\na. Call the army to secure the airports.\nb. How about we call the army to secure the airports?\nc. Nice weather we're having, isn't it?\nd. Calling the army is a crypto-fascist response that imperils democracy.",

Farmers in Flanders pioneered a four-field crop rotation system which meant fewer fields were left fallow. Charles Townsend introduced this to Britain, and, as a result, crop yields improved. The introduction of greater cultivation of turnips and clover also lead to a rise in the number of ruminant animals raised, and the use of these animals increased yields of meat and dairy products.\nWhat can this writer do to improve cohesion in this passage?\n\na.

What part did the system of alliances play in causing the conflict? Was a military arms race between the Great Powers a major influence? Did colonialism play a part in leading to the conflict?\"\n\nHere is a student's essay introduction and conclusion in response to this question.\n\n\"The First World War was one of the largest conflicts of the 20th century, leading to millions of deaths both in Europe and around the world. Unlike other conflicts in the 20th century, the causes of the conflict were many and various, and historians have had a difficult time deciding what the primary causes were. The system of alliances, rising militarism amongst the Great Powers, the politics surrounding a united Germany, and even the Industrial Revolution have been posited as short and long term causes of the war. However, it is two of these in particular - the system of alliances in Europe, and a military arms race in Europe - that were particularly prominent causes of the conflict.\n\nTo sum up, the combination of the system of alliances and rising militarism amongst European countries - leading to an arms race amongst the countries - were the two main causes of the First World War. The system of alliances lead to an \"excessively rigid framework\" (Taylor, 1969), which was unable to deal with diplomatic events such as the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand. Coupled with this was the immense military buildup and planning amongst the Great Powers, which created a great impetus for war. It is these two issues, in excess of others, that led to the bloodshed of the First World War.\"\n\nThe student has unfortunately failed to address one part of the question. Which part of the question has the student failed to answer?\n\na. The system of alliances amongst the Great Powers.\nb. The role of colonialism in causing the First World War.\nc. The military arms race as a cause of the First World War.\nd. Domestic issues for the European Great Powers.",

Transactional leadership is largely seen as recruiting the participation of employees through material rewards, and in cases where employees do not follow directives, through punishments. The appeal of the transactional leader is attained by appealing to employees own self-interest through such things as incentives and job security. The transactional leader is seen as someone who is responsive to external threats and directives from leaders above, and largely works within the organizational culture. Their overall objective is to maintain the status quo. Many writers feel that the transactional leader is somehow inferior to the transformational leader outlined below, but in my opinion organisations need transactional leaders as much as transformational leaders. If an organisation had too many transformational leaders, it would be a case of 'too many chiefs not enough Indians'. In contrast with transactional leaders, transformational leaders are seen as proactive rather than just reactive. Transformational leaders inspire followers through their ideals, idea and morals rather than ....\"\n\nWhat structural issue does this excerpt have?\n\nA. The paragraphing is wrong.\nB. It doesn't answer the question.\nC. It lacks coherence.\nD. It lacks cohesion.",

Transactional leadership is largely seen as recruiting the participation of employees through material rewards, and in cases where employees do not follow directives, through punishments. The appeal of the transactional leader is attained by appealing to employees own self-interest through such things as incentives and job security. The transactional leader is seen as someone who is responsive to external threats and directives from leaders above, and largely works within the organizational culture. Their overall objective is to maintain the status quo. Many writers feel that the transactional leader is somehow inferior to the transformational leader outlined below, but in my opinion organisations need transactional leaders as much as transformational leaders. If an organisation had too many transformational leaders, it would be a case of 'too many chiefs not enough Indians'.

Each student will be allocated a week in which to present. The presentations will last for 15 minutes, with the final 5 minutes allocated to discussion of the topic amongst the tutorial group. Student will be required to quickly present the main points of the readings, find similarities and differences, and try to apply the ideas to real world language situations. They will also need to lead the discussion in the final 5 minutes of the presentation.\nYou are going to make this presentation next week, and would like to show a video of a short segment of classroom discussion. What are your three most important considerations with regard to Place before you make your presentation?\nCheck three options.\n\n1. The seating arrangement in the room\n2. Whether the projector is working.\n3. Whether the sound is working.\n4. Whether you can use PowerPoint or not.\n5. Whether you can play the video file of the classroom discussion on the computer in the room.",
